<h3>Handling</h3>




<p>Handle your phone with care. You may damage the device or the battery if you disassemble, drop, bend, burn, crush or puncture your device. Do not use a phone with a damaged enclosure, a cracked screen or some other form of physical damage. Using a damaged phone may cause overheating or injury. Do not expose your phone to liquids, which can cause a short circuit and overheating. If your phone gets wet, do not attempt to dry it using an external heat source.</p>




<p>Your phone works best in ambient temperatures between 0° and 35°C (32° and 95°F), and should be stored between ambient temperatures of -20° and 45°C (-4° and 113°F). Do not expose your phone to temperatures above 45°C (113°F), such as on a car dashboard or near a radiator, as this may damage the phone, overheat the battery or pose a risk of fire. Keep your phone away from heat sources and out of direct sunlight. If your device becomes too hot, disconnect it from its power source if it is plugged in, move it to a cooler place and do not use it until it has cooled. Your phone is designed to work best at an altitude of up to 5,000 m (16,404 ft).</p>




<p>Use of your phone in certain modes, such as gaming, taking videos, using a torch setting, or virtual reality or augmented reality features, can cause it to generate more heat than it would under normal operating conditions. This may cause your phone to operate in a reduced-power mode or temporarily shut down. Use extra care when operating the device in these modes. For more information on risks associated with prolonged heat exposure, please refer to the Prolonged heat exposure section below.</p>




<h3>Repair and service</h3>




<p>Self-service repair is not recommended unless you are an adult with the technical expertise to safely repair electronic devices. If you choose to perform self-repair, you agree to assume the risk associated with such repair. Use caution if engaging in repair. Opening and/or repairing your device can present electric shock, device damage, fire and personal injury risks and other hazards. Disassembling the device may result in loss of water or dust resistance or cause injury or damage to your device. For example, the device contains a laser that can be damaged during disassembly, which might expose you to hazardous laser emissions that are not visible. </p>




<p>Contact customer service if your phone is not working properly or has been damaged. For more information, visit <a href="https://g.co/pixelcare"  target="_blank">g.co/pixelcare</a>.</p>




<h3>Charging</h3>




<p>Make sure that the power adaptor and phone are well ventilated when in use or charging. Using damaged cables or power adaptors, or charging when moisture is present, can cause fire, electric shock, injury or damage to the phone or other property. Do not charge your phone when it’s wet. Avoid charging your device in direct sunlight.</p>




<p>When charging the device, make sure that the power adaptor is plugged into a power socket near the device and is easily accessible. Do not force this power adaptor and other plugs or power adaptors into a power socket if space is not sufficient to accommodate both. When disconnecting the power adaptor from a power socket, pull on the adaptor, never on the charging cable. Do not twist or pinch the cable, and do not force a connector into a port. If you receive a message while charging that instructs you to unplug the charging device, disconnect the charging device or power adaptor. Before attempting to charge again, make sure that both the charging cable connector and the device's charging port are dry and clear of any objects.<mark> </mark></p>




<p>Only charge your phone with the included cable or compatible charging accessories, which are available on the Google Store or at Google authorised resellers (look for Google’s 'Made For' badge). The AC adaptor must be certified with a limited power source output per IEC 60950-1 and/or classified PS2 per IEC 62368-1, rated: 5 volts DC, maximum 3 amp; 9 volts DC, maximum 3 amp; or both, and qualified per CTIA certification requirements for battery system compliance to IEEE 1725. Failure to use compatible charging accessories can cause fire, electric shock, injury or damage to the device and the accessories.</p>




<h3>Wireless charging</h3>




<p>Your phone may be charged with a Qi-compliant or Google-approved wireless charger. Do not place other metallic or magnetic objects between the wireless charger and your phone, as this could cause heating of the other object or cause your device not to charge properly. Examples of such objects include coins, jewellery, SIM tray tools and credit cards. If using a metallic or magnetic phone case, remove the case prior to wireless charging, as this may cause the device or charger to overheat, or cause the device not to charge properly.</p>




<h3>Prolonged heat exposure</h3>




<p>The phone and its charger generate heat during normal operation and comply with applicable surface temperature standards and limits. Avoid prolonged skin contact when the device is in use or charging because exposing skin to hot surfaces for a long period of time may cause discomfort or burns. Do not sleep on or with your device or its power adaptor, or cover them with a blanket or pillow. Be aware of this issue if you have a physical condition that affects your ability to detect heat against your skin.</p>

<h4>Specific absorption rate (SAR) information</h4>




<p>Your phone is a radio transmitter and receiver. It complies with the international guidelines in relation to the limiting of human exposure to electromagnetic fields and has been specifically designed to meet the guidelines for exposure to radio waves established by the Department of Telecommunications, Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, Government of India ('DoT'). The guidelines use a unit of measurement known as specific absorption rate (SAR), which is a unit of body-absorbed radio frequency quantity when the phone is in use. The SAR limit in India for mobile devices is 1.6 W/kg over a mass of 1 gram of human tissue.<br />
  <br />
  This phone complies with these guidelines when used against the head with no separation and body with 10 mm separation. Ensure that device accessories, such as device case and device holster, are not composed of metal components. Keep the device away from your body to meet the distance requirement.</p>




<p>For Pixel 8a, the highest Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values reported are:</p>




<ul>
  <li>Head: 1.11 W/kg.</li>
  <li>Body: 1.00 W/kg.</li>
</ul>




<p><br />
  You can also see SAR values on the website of the DoT/Telecommunication Engineering Centre.<br />
  <br />
  While most of the laboratory studies have been unable to find a direct link between exposure to radio frequency radiation and health, the DoT has prescribed the following precautionary measures while using the mobile handset:</p>




<ul>
  <li>Use a wireless hands-free system (headphone, headset) with a lower-power Bluetooth emitter.</li>
  <li>Make sure that the mobile phone has a low SAR. Keep your calls short or send a text message (SMS) instead. This advice applies especially to children, adolescents and pregnant women.</li>
  <li>Use your mobile phone when the signal quality is good. People with active medical implants should preferably keep the mobile phone at least 15 cm away from the implant.</li>
</ul>
