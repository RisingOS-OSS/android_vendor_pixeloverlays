<h3>Handling</h3>


<p>Handle your phone with care. You may damage the phone or the battery if you disassemble, drop, bend, burn, crush or puncture your device. Do not use a phone with a damaged enclosure, a cracked screen or some other form of physical damage. Using a damaged phone may cause overheating or injury. Do not expose your phone to liquids, which can cause a short circuit and overheating. If your phone gets wet, do not attempt to dry it using an external heat source.</p>


<p>Your phone is designed to work best in ambient temperatures between 0° and 35°C (32° and 95°F), and should be stored between ambient temperatures of -20° and 45°C (-4° and 113°F). Do not expose your phone to temperatures above 45°C (113°F), such as on a car dashboard or near a radiator, as this may damage the phone, overheat the battery or pose a risk of fire. Keep your phone away from heat sources and out of direct sunlight. If your device becomes too hot, disconnect it from its power source if it is plugged in, move it to a cooler place and do not use it until it has cooled. Your phone is designed to work best at an altitude of up to 2,000 m (6,562 ft).</p>


<p>Use of your phone in certain modes, such as gaming, taking videos, using a torch setting, or virtual reality or augmented reality features, can cause it to generate more heat than it would under normal operating conditions. This may cause your phone to operate in a reduced-power mode or temporarily shut down. Use extra care when operating the device in these modes. For more information on risks associated with prolonged heat exposure, please refer to the prolonged heat exposure section below.</p>


<h3>Repair and service</h3>


<p>Do not attempt to repair your phone yourself. Disassembling the device may result in loss of water resistance or cause injury or damage to your device.</p>


<p>For example, the device contains a laser that can be damaged during disassembly which might expose you to hazardous laser emissions which are not visible.</p>

<h4>Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) information</h4>


<p>Your phone is a radio transmitter and receiver. It complies with the international guidelines in relation to the limiting of human exposure to electromagnetic fields and has been specifically designed to meet the guidelines for exposure to radio waves established by the Department of Telecommunications, Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, Government of India ('DoT'). The guidelines use a unit of measurement known as Specific Absorption Rate ('SAR') which is a unit of body-absorbed radio frequency quantity when the phone is in use. The SAR limit in India for mobile devices is 1.6 W/kg over a mass of 1 gram of human tissue.</p>


<p>Pixel 6a complies with these guidelines when used against the head with no separation, and against the body with 10 mm separation. Ensure that device accessories, such as device case and device holster, are not composed of metal components. Keep the device away from your body to meet the distance requirement.</p>


<p>For Pixel 6a, the highest Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values reported are:</p>


<ul>
  <li>Head: 1.10 W/kg,</li>
  <li>Body: 1.16 W/kg.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can also see SAR values on the website of the DoT/Telecommunication Engineering Centre.</p>


<p>While most of the laboratory studies have been unable to find a direct link between exposure to radio frequency radiation and health, the DoT has prescribed the following precautionary measures while using the mobile handset:</p>


<ul>
  <li>Use a wireless hands-free system (headphone, headset) with a lower power Bluetooth emitter.</li>
  <li>Make sure that the mobile phone has a low SAR. Keep your calls short or send a text message (SMS) instead. This advice applies especially to children, adolescents and pregnant women.</li>
  <li>Use mobile phone when the signal quality is good. People with active medical implants should preferably keep the mobile phone at least 15 cm away from the implant.</li>
</ul>
