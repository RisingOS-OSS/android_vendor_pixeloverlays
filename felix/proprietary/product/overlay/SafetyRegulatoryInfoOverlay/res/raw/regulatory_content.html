<h3>Handling</h3>

<p>Handle your phone with care. You may damage the device or the batteries if you disassemble, drop, bend, burn, crush or puncture your device. Do not use a phone with a damaged enclosure, a cracked screen or some other form of physical damage. Using a damaged phone may cause overheating or injury. Do not expose your phone to liquids, which can cause a short circuit and overheating. If your phone gets wet, do not attempt to dry it using an external heat source.</p>

<p>Your phone works best in ambient temperatures between 32° and 95° F (0° and 35° C), and should be stored between ambient temperatures of -4° and 113° F (-20° and 45° C). Do not expose your phone to temperatures above 113° F (45° C), such as on a car dashboard or near a heating vent, as this may damage the phone, overheat the batteries, or pose a risk of fire. Keep your phone away from heat sources and out of direct sunlight. If your device becomes too hot, disconnect it from its power source if it is plugged in, move it to a cooler place and do not use it until it has cooled. Your phone is designed to work best at an altitude of up to 16404 ft (5000m). Do not open or close your device in extreme cold temperatures of -4° F (-20° C) or lower, as it may damage the phone.</p>

<p>Use of your phone in certain modes, such as gaming, taking videos, using a flashlight setting, or virtual reality or augmented reality features, can cause it to generate more heat than it would under normal operating conditions. This may cause your phone to operate in a reduced-power mode or temporarily shut down. Use extra care when operating the device in these modes. For more information on risks associated with prolonged heat exposure, please refer to the Prolonged Heat Exposure section below.</p>

<h3>Repair &amp; service</h3>

<p>Self service repair is not recommended unless you are an adult with the technical expertise to safely repair electronic devices. If you choose to self repair, you agree to assume the risk associated with such repair. Use caution if engaging in repair. Opening and/or repairing your device can present electric shock, device damage, fire and personal injury risks, and other hazards. Disassembling the device may result in loss of water resistance or cause injury or damage to your device. For example, the device contains a laser that can be damaged during disassembly which might expose you to hazardous laser emissions which are not visible.</p>

<p>Contact customer service if it isn’t working properly or has been damaged. For more information, visit <a href="https://g.co/pixelcare" rel="noopener" target="_blank">g.co/pixelcare</a>.</p>

<h3>Charging</h3>

<p>Be sure the power adapter and phone are well ventilated when in use or charging. Using damaged cables or power adapters, or charging when moisture is present, can cause fire, electric shock, injury, or damage to the phone or other property. Do not charge your phone when it’s wet. Avoid charging your device in direct sunlight.</p>

<p>When charging the device, make sure the power adapter is plugged into a power outlet near the device and is easily accessible. Do not force this power adapter and other plugs or power adapters to a power outlet if space is not sufficient to accommodate both. When disconnecting the power adapter from a power outlet, pull on the adapter, never on the charging cable. Do not twist or pinch the cable, and do not force a connector into a port. If you receive a message while charging that instructs you to unplug the power adapter, disconnect the power adapter. Before attempting to charge again, make sure both the charging cable connector and the device's charging port are dry and clear of any objects.</p>

<p>Only charge your phone with the included cable or compatible charging accessories available on the Google Store or at Google authorized resellers (look for Google’s "made for" badge). The AC adapter must be certified with a Limited Power Source output per IEC 60950-1 and/or classified PS2 per IEC 62368-1, rated: 5 Volts DC, maximum 3 Amp; 9 Volts DC, maximum 3 Amp when used with USB PD enabled AC adapter, and up to 11 Volts DC, maximum 3 Amp for USB PD 3.0 PPS enabled AC adapter and qualified per CTIA Certification Requirements for Battery System Compliance to IEEE 1725. Failure to use compatible charging accessories can cause fire, electric shock, injury, or damage to the device and the accessories.</p>

<h3>Wireless charging</h3>

<p>Your phone may be charged with a Qi-compatible or Google-approved wireless charger. Do not place other metallic or magnetic objects between the wireless charger and your phone, as this could cause heating of the other object or cause your device not to charge properly. Examples of such objects include coins, jewelry, SIM tray tools and credit cards. If using a phone case that is metallic or magnetic, remove the case prior to wireless charging as this may cause the device or charger to overheat or cause the device not to charge properly.</p>

<h3>Prolonged heat exposure</h3>

<p>The phone and its charger generate heat during normal operation and comply with applicable surface temperature standards and limits. Avoid prolonged skin contact when the device is in use or charging because exposing skin to hot surfaces for a long period of time may cause discomfort or burns. Do not sleep on or with your device or its power adapter, or cover them with a blanket or pillow. Be aware of this issue if you have a physical condition that affects your ability to detect heat against your skin.</p>

<h3>Child safety</h3>

<p>This device is not a toy. Your phone may contain (or may come with) small parts, plastic, glass, or metal elements, and parts with sharp edges that may cause an injury or create a choking hazard. Children have strangled on cords and cables. Keep the phone’s cords and cables out of the reach of children (more than 3 feet (0.9 meters) away) and do not allow them to play with the phone and its accessories.
