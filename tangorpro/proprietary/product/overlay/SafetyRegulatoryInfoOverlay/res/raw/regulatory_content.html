<h3>Handling</h3>

<p>Handle your tablet, dock and accessories with care. You may damage the device or any included batteries or accessories if you disassemble, drop, bend, burn, crush or puncture your device. Make sure to gently detach the tablet when it is docked. Do not use a tablet, dock and accessories with a damaged enclosure, a cracked screen or some other form of physical damage. Using a damaged tablet, dock and accessories may cause overheating or injury. Do not expose your devices to liquids, which can cause a short circuit and overheating. If any of your devices get wet, do not attempt to dry it using an external heat source.</p>

<p>Tablet, dock and the accessories are designed to operate in a dry, indoor environment. Your devices work best in ambient temperatures between 32° and 95° F (0° and 35° C), and should be stored between ambient temperatures of -4° and 113° F (-20° and 45° C). Do not expose your devices to temperatures above 113° F (45° C), such as on a car dashboard or near a heating vent, as this may damage the devices, overheat the battery, or pose a risk of fire. Keep your devices away from heat sources and out of direct sunlight. If your device becomes too hot, disconnect it from its power source if it is plugged in, move it to a cooler place and do not use it until it has cooled. Your products are designed to work best at an altitude of up to 16404 ft (5000m).</p>

<p>Use of your tablet in certain modes, such as gaming, taking videos, using a flashlight setting, or virtual reality or augmented reality features, can cause it to generate more heat than it would under typical operating conditions. &nbsp;This may cause your tablet to operate in a reduced-power mode or temporarily shut down.
