<h3>Handling</h3>

<p>Handle your tablet, dock and accessories with care. You may damage the device or any included batteries or accessories if you disassemble, drop, bend, burn, crush or puncture your device. Make sure that you gently detach the tablet when it is docked. Do not use a tablet, dock and accessories with a damaged enclosure, a cracked screen or some other form of physical damage. Using a damaged tablet, dock and accessories may cause overheating or injury. Do not expose your devices to liquids, which can cause a short circuit and overheating. If any of your devices get wet, do not attempt to dry them using an external heat source.</p>

<p>Tablet, dock and the accessories are designed to operate in a dry, indoor environment. Your devices work best in ambient temperatures between 0° and 35°C (32° and 95°F), and should be stored between ambient temperatures of -20° and 45°C (-4° and 113°F). Do not expose your devices to temperatures above 45°C (113°F), such as on a car dashboard or near a radiator, as this may damage the devices, overheat the battery or pose a risk of fire. Keep your devices away from heat sources and out of direct sunlight. If your device becomes too hot, disconnect it from its power source if it is plugged in, move it to a cooler place, and do not use it until it has cooled. Your products are designed to work best at an altitude of up to 5,000 m (16,404 ft).</p>

<p>Use of your tablet in certain modes, such as gaming, taking videos, using a torch setting, or virtual reality or augmented reality features, can cause it to generate more heat than it would under typical operating conditions. &nbsp;This may cause your tablet to operate in a reduced-power mode or temporarily shut down. Use extra care when operating the device in these modes. &nbsp;For more information on risks associated with prolonged heat exposure, please refer to the prolonged heat exposure section below.</p>

<h3>Repair and service</h3>

<p>Do not attempt to repair your tablet, dock and accessories yourself. Disassembling the device may cause injury or damage to your device. Contact customer service if the product is not working properly or has been damaged. For more information, visit <a href="https://g.co/pixeltablet/care"  target="_blank">g.co/pixeltablet/care</a>.</p>

<h3>Charging</h3>

<p>Make sure that the charging dock, power adaptor and tablet are well ventilated when in use or charging. Using damaged cables or power adaptors, or charging when moisture is present, can cause fire, electric shock, injury or damage to the devices or other property. Ensure that the charging pins are free of moisture or debris prior to docking. Do not charge your tablet when it’s wet. Avoid charging your device in direct sunlight.</p>

<p>When charging the device, make sure that the power adaptor is plugged into a power socket near the device and is easily accessible. Do not force the power adaptor and other plugs into a power socket if space is not sufficient to accommodate both. When disconnecting the power adaptor from a power socket, pull on the adaptor, never on the charging cable. Do not twist or pinch the cable, and do not force a connector into a port. Follow the instructions if you receive a message while charging that instructs you to unplug the power adaptor or detach from the dock. Before attempting to charge again, make sure that both the power adaptor, cable connector and the device's charging port are dry and clear of any objects.</p>

<p>Do not place metallic or magnetic objects on the exposed pins of the dock and tablet when it is docked, as this could cause heating of the object or device.</p>

<p>The Charging Speaker Dock comes with an AC adaptor that has appropriate certifications.</p>

<p>Charge your tablet with a USB-C PD-compliant charger or compatible charging accessories available on the Google Store or at Google authorised resellers (look for Google’s 'Made For' badge). The AC adaptor must be certified with a limited power source output per IEC 60950-1 and/or classified PS2 per IEC 62368-1, rated: 5 Volts DC, maximum 3 Amp; 9 Volts DC, maximum 2 Amp; or both. Failure to use compatible charging accessories can cause fire, electric shock, injury or damage to the device and the accessories.</p>

<h3>Prolonged heat exposure</h3>

<p>The tablet, dock and its power adaptor generate heat during normal operation and comply with applicable surface temperature standards and limits. &nbsp;Avoid prolonged skin contact when the device is in use or charging because exposing skin to hot surfaces for a long period of time may cause discomfort or burns.
